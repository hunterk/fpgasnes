* Fix mode 7 and complete test
	- FlipH/V.
	- Fill loop.
	- Transform beeing correct.
	- Mosaic (including FLIP)
	- See interlace support.
	
	--> Use screen shot from Axelay with monster (transform/fill)
	--> Use screen shot from Act Raiser (transform/fill)
	--> Patch register and look how it is with emulator. -> flip/fill

* Finish blending between BG1/2/3/4
	- Color window clip. / CGWSEL (0x30 cc mm)
	- Color math.
	
* Obj clipping window logic.

* Mosaic support for weird mode X,Y in mode 7 (BG 1)

* Tile Offset Mode

* Interlace
	- Mode7
	- Sprite
	- Other mode
	
* HiRes
	- Mode 7 ? FlipH/V
	- Sprites ? (Doubled ?)
	
* Sprites
	- Tile unit X computation for display most unlikely correct.

* Register interface
	- Implement sprites (OAM)
	- Implement CGRAM / VRAM.

============================
Sprite support :
- 0x01 : Sprite size / Name Select / Base Select
- OAM Table read
	x,y,char,v/h/pal/prio/Bank/size


	4x 128*8 bit + 1x 32*8 bit

	Input is using nintendo specs:

	Output as 34 bit record for each sprite.

	Unit A : output sprite record. (active sprite)
		
	Unit B : Count the sprites.
	Unit C : Return if a sprite is visible or not.
	Unit D : Increment and load each sprite
		=> Maintain sprite counter overflow.
		=> Main tile counter 
	
Dump :
- OAM Table read/write -> Simulate all sprite write.
